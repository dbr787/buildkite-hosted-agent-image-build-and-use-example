# Buildkite Hosted Agent Image Build and Use Example

[![Add to Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/button.svg)](https://buildkite.com/new)

This repository demonstrates how to build a custom Docker image in Buildkite and use it in subsequent pipeline steps with hosted agents.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline consists of two main steps:

1. **Build Base Image**: Creates a custom Docker image with Node.js and development tools
2. **Use Base Image**: Runs commands using the newly built image on hosted agents

## Files

- `.buildkite/pipeline.yml` - Main pipeline configuration
- `.buildkite/Dockerfile.build` - Dockerfile for the base image

## Setup Requirements

1. **Buildkite Organization**: Ensure you have access to Buildkite hosted agents
2. **Container Registry**: The pipeline uses `nsc workspace describe` to get registry URL
3. **Agent Queues**: 
   - `linux-arm64-small-default` - For building the image
   - `linux-arm64-small-custom` - For using the custom image

## Pipeline Steps

### Step 1: Build Base Image
- Runs on the default agent queue
- Builds a multi-platform Docker image (AMD64/ARM64)
- Pushes to the workspace container registry
- Adds a success annotation

### Step 2: Use Custom Image
- Depends on the base image build step
- Runs on agents using the custom image queue
- Demonstrates that the custom tools are available

## Running the Pipeline

### Initial Setup

1. Connect this repository to your Buildkite pipeline
2. Set the pipeline configuration to use `.buildkite/pipeline.yml`
3. Trigger a build

### First Run Configuration

On the first run, the pipeline will build and push your custom image, but the second step may fail because the custom queue doesn't know about the new image yet.

**After the first successful image build:**

1. Check the build annotation from the first step - it will show something like:
   ```
   ðŸš€ Image pushed to your-registry.com/base:latest ðŸš€
   ```

2. Copy the registry URL from this annotation (e.g., `your-registry.com/base:latest`)

3. In your Buildkite organization settings:
   - Navigate to the `linux-arm64-small-custom` queue configuration
   - Update the **Base Image** setting to use the registry URL from the annotation
   - Save the configuration

4. Re-run the pipeline - now the second step will successfully use your custom image

### Subsequent Runs

Once configured, the pipeline will automatically build your custom image and use it in the next step. The custom queue will pull the latest version of your image for each build.

## Customization

Modify `.buildkite/Dockerfile.build` to include your specific dependencies and tools. The image will be available for use in subsequent pipeline steps.
